These are unprecedented times indeed.

Times we will be telling kids and grandkids about in decades to come. With that in mind I wanted to get some documentation of the centre of Glasgow. Not for any morbid reason - purely to have seen it with my own eyes and to be able to show it to the girls when they're old enough to really understand what was going on.

I described what I saw to one of my friends as almost an 'uncanny valley' version of Glasgow, almost right but something was just a bit off. The lack of people hustling and bustling about.

The photos I grabbed aren't the best but I was conscious of not wanting to appear reckless in my exercise time (I was out on the bike doing the sub ride, more on that another time)
