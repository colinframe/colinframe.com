At times undoubtedly super hard but there were some bright spots.

I’ll preface this by saying that this is my personal perspective on what I experienced through the first lockdown last March. I know that for a lot of people they found it an all together much more challenging time.

As a society we were thrown into entirely unknown waters. I still remember running round the local neighbourhood being able to run down the middle of roads that at any other time would be permanently busy with traffic.

## Family

My wife and I had to figure out how to juggle work and looking after our 2 young daughters who, at that point, were both still in nursery. As my job had more flexibility I would start work somewhere around 6am and bank some ‘quiet time’ to concentrate before the breakfast routine would kick off. I’d usually work till 10ish then take a couple of hours or so out to get the kids out the house and into the fresh air.

It was in those few hours that I found most of the goodness in lockdown. My daughters now have such a tight bond, mostly forged through having to spend so much time together over the last year - mercifully, they’re pretty good together! We’d go for picnics in the local nature walk, we rode around all the back lanes here over a few weeks, marking them off on a map as we went. They would build dens using a giant cardboard box in the house, make a cinema screening room out of a pop up tent in the garden - yes, I realise we were very lucky to have both a garden and the weather to use it.

I also found that having to split my time between them and work made me be more focussed on each ‘mode’ I was in, while I was in it. It took some doing and it’s where a good chunk of my desire to [take back my attention](https://www.colinframe.com/taking-back-my-attention) came from. What I’m trying to do now is to keep my phone out of reach while I’m with the girls so I give them my full attention.

## Work

Having to split my days so much between work and childcare also forced me to try and be more productive when I was in a work block. Simple things like closing my email client most of the time made a big difference. I now schedule time for getting my email handled and it’s working well so far.

I also started to work on systems to try and 'get things done'. I'd finished reading [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-free-Productivity/dp/0349408947) sometime in 2019 which helped a lot. I'm still trying to work out exactly what the system is by writing it up in a blog post but Lockdown 3 and home schooling is kinda scuppering that at the moment!

## Personal

As much as I was taking a lot from spending more time with the kids I still needed some time to clear my head. To this end I made a concerted effort to get out on the bike more than in previous years. Suddenly being told that something was scarce, exercise in the case, made me realise how much I enjoyed and maybe even needed to be able to get out and pedal.

The travel restrictions did curtail some of my usual routes but that just forced me to be a bit more creative. I visited a few of the Glasgow parks that I'd never been to, found an amazing loch in the Kilpatricks that I never knew existed and got to ride some dusty gravel trails in both the outskirts of Glasgow and on Arran - both of which would have given California a run for its money!

This year, I hope I don't forget how getting out exploring balances my mind. My mood is better, I'm more present with Lynn & the kids and I feel like I'm a better person for it.

It's all too easy to get wrapped up in the urgent and forget about the important.
