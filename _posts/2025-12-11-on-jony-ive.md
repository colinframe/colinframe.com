# On Jony Ive

Over the last couple of weeks I’ve found myself going on a journey finding out about Jony Ive in his post-Apple time.

A lot of people will know his recent history but a lot of it was news to me so here we go, my dive into his recent past and what he’s up to with OpenAI.

On leaving Apple Ive went on to found a design collective called [LoveFrom,](https://www.lovefrom.com) along with Marc Newson. Initially LoveFrom, continued to be have a strong involvement with the Apple design teams along with many other high end brands such as [Moncler](https://www.moncler.com/en-gb/sir-jony-ive-collaboration), [Airbnb](https://news.airbnb.com/designing-the-future-of-airbnb/) and [Ferrari](https://www.ferrari.com/en-EN/corporate/articles/exor-ferrari-and-lovefrom-announce-creative-partnership), amongst others.

Aside from working with these brands, LoveFrom, also created a new font called [LoveFrom, Serif](https://www.wallpaper.com/design-interiors/corporate-design-branding/lovefrom-serif-a-modern-interpretation-of-baskerville-created-by-jony-ives-lovefrom) which is a modern interpretation of Baskerville, a font created in the 1700s. The font has been noticeably used on the [Terra Carta](https://www.wallpaper.com/design/terra-carta-seal-design-lovefrom-jony-ive) for HRH King Charles and a limited edition book for the Steve Jobs Archive: [Make Something Wonderful](https://stevejobsarchive.com/book). Whilst the print book was a limited edition run, you can read the entire text on their website or download an EPUB version for an e-reader of your choice.

In early 2024 Ive quietly founded io Products, Inc. which was to specialise in developing hardware for AI. Later that year OpenAI took a 23% stake in the company before merging with it outright in May 2025.

Over the years he’s carried out a number of interviews which have had interesting insights with a number of common themes throughout them.
