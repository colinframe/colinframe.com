A couple of weeks ago on a gloriously sunny, if chilly, Monday I took a wee spin out to Linn Park in the south side of Glasgow. Despite having lived in Glasgow my whole life Iâ€™ve never really explored much of the south side of the city and it was a post from [Rothair Cycles on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_zhiKalOFK/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) that inspired me to head out this way.
