I started watching this video [about the development of the LoveFrom, Serif typeface](https://youtu.be/5b6g8eT0uuc?t=295) the other night as it sounded interesting and I’ve been digging in to what LoveFrom, has produced. The talk was introduced by Jony Ive and his opening line stopped me in my tracks:

> “It’s a real honour actually I think to be able to share work, not to try and sell work or market work but just very simply to show you what we’re doing.”

To me that sums up everything that’s broken with the majority of social media these days. Everything has become monetised to such an extent that a lot of the time my feeling is that almost everybody is trying to sell or market _something_.
