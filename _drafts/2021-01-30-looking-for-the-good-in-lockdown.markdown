At times undoubtedly super hard but there were some bright spots. 

I’ll preface this by saying that this is purely my personal perspective on what I experienced through the first lockdown last March. I know that for a lot of people they found it an all together much more challenging time. 

As a society we were thrown into entirely unknown waters. I still remember running round the local neighbourhood being able to run down the middle of roads that at any other time would be permanently busy with traffic. 

For our my wife and I we had to figure out how to juggle work and looking after our 2 young daughters who, at that point, were both still in nursery. As my job had significantly more flexibility I would start work somewhere around 6am and bank some ‘quiet time’ to concentrate before the breakfast routine would kick off. I’d usually work till 10ish then take 2-3 hours out to get the kids out the house and into the fresh air, possibly leading to doing a bit of work in the evening. 

It was in those 2-3 hours that I found most of the goodness in lockdown. My daughters now have such a tight bond, mostly forged through having to spend so much time together over the last year - mercifully, they’re pretty good together! We’d go for picnics in the local nature walk, we rode around all the back lanes here over a few weeks, marking them off on a map as we went. They would build dens using a giant cardboard box in the house, make a cinema screening room out of a pop up tent in the garden - yes, how lucky we were to both have a garden and have weather to use it. 

I also found that having to split my time between them and work made me be more focussed on each ‘mode’ I was in, while I was in it.
