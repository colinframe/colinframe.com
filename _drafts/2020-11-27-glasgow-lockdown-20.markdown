It happened again.

Once again Glasgow, and a large swathe of the Central Belt of Scotland has been placed into another ‘lockdown’ to try and stem the tide of COVID. On Friday 20th November we were placed into Tier 4 which is essentially the same as the lockdown conditions we faced all the way back in March.

Once again, I thought I should take a wee wander through town on the bike to see what the place ‘felt’ like this time round.

What I found was a little more life than previous but nothing compared to what you would expect for this time of year. That said, there were still a few glimmers of happiness to be found.
