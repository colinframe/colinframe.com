Using a mix of David Allen’s GTD, Greg McKeown’s essentialism, Cal Newport’s time block planning and the Time Dorks’ approaches to technology.

GTD Horizons of Focus

H5 - Purpose/Principles (Life Planning)
H4 - 3-5 Year Vision (Long Term outcomes and ideal scenarios)
H3 - Goals and Objectives (3-24 months)
H2 - Life
H1 - Projects (This Quarter)

H4 scenarios should ideally link back to H5 tenets.
H3 projects should link back to H4 scenarios.
H1 projects should link back to H4 scenarios.


Should H4 smart lists move into H3 goals and then H1 as smart lists containing items taken from Actionable(?) that are associated via tags? This would certainly keep actionable items very clearly aligned or misaligned with the main goals…
